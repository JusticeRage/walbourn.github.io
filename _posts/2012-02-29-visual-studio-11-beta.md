For an overview of the new product, take a moment to read this <a href="">Visual Studio blog</a> entry as well as an entry on the <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/whats-new-in-visual-studio-11-beta-for-c-developers/">Visual C++ blog</a>. This Beta release includes the full range of SKUs including <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=28974">Express</a>, <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=28992">Professional</a>, <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=28985">Premium</a>, and <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=28975">Ultimate</a>.

The VS 11 Beta includes a Beta version of the next <a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/sdk-archive">Windows SDK</a> integrated into the release. This new SDK has a number of DirectX SDK components built in, including the Developer Runtime components (REF, D3D10 SDK Layers, D3D11 SDK Layers) for Windows 7 and Windows 8 Consumer Preview. Building the DirectX SDK samples using the new Windows SDK requires some build settings changes. See "<a href="https://aka.ms/dxsdk">Where is the DirectX SDK</a>" for further details.

> If you are looking to move applications written using the Developer Preview release to the new Beta, you should keep a link to this <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=242888">migration guide</a> handy.
