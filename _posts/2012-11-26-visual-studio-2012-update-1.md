An update to Visual Studio 2012 is now available for <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/eng/downloads#d-visual-studio-2012-update">download</a>. For full details, see the following blog posts: <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/visual-studio-2012-update-1-is-here/">Visual Studio team blog</a>, <span class="breadcrumb-item2"><a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/somasegar/visual-studio-2012-update-1-now-available/">Somasegar's blog</a>, and </span><a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/devops/visual-studio-and-team-foundation-server-2012-update-1-now-available/">Visual Studio ALM + Team Foundation Server blog</a>.

This update includes support for targeting Windows XP with the Visual C++ 2012 toolset and CRT. This provides C++11 Language and Standard Library support for Win32 desktop applications compatible with the <a href="https://walbourn.github.io/goodbye-to-an-old-friend/">legacy Windows XP platform</a>. This is accomplished through using the Platform Toolset ``v110_xp``. Details on this were announced for the <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/windows-xp-targeting-with-c-in-visual-studio-2012/">CTP</a>.

See <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2797915">KB 2797915</a>

<h1>Compiler and CRT</h1>

<em>VS 2012 Update 1</em> includes a new version of the compiler (17.00.51106) and C/C++ Runtime (11.0.51106).

<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30679">MSDN downloads</a> has the updated retail redistribution packages which are now compatible with Windows XP Service Pack 3.

<h1>Windows SDK and Windows XP</h1>

First be sure to read this <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/windows-xp-targeting-with-c-in-visual-studio-2012/">blog post</a> by the Visual Studio team. When building applications that support the legacy Windows XP platform, you are using a platform header and library set similar to those that shipped in the <a href="https://walbourn.github.io/windows-sdk-7-1/">Windows 7.1 SDK</a> rather than the <em>Windows 8.x SDK</em> with the integrated <em>DirectX SDK</em> content (see <a href="https://aka.ms/dxsdk">Where is the DirectX SDK?</a>). Many of the "DirectX" headers and libraries are included with these Windows XP compatible platform headers (see <a href="https://walbourn.github.io/directx-sdks-of-a-certain-age/">DirectX SDKs of a certain age</a>) such as Direct3D 9, DirectSound, and DirectInput. You will, however, need to continue to use the legacy <em>DirectX SDK</em> for Windows XP compatible versions of the D3DCompile API (#43), legacy D3DX9, XAUDIO2, XINPUT, and <em>PIX for Windows</em> tool (the Visual Studio 2012 Graphics Debugger does not support Direct3D 9 applications).

<em>Windows SDK 7.1A</em> is installed as part of VS 2012 Update 1 for use with the ``v110_xp`` Platform Toolset, which contains the headers, libraries, and a subset of the tools that originally shipped in the <em>Windows SDK 7.1</em>. There are older Direct3D 10 and Direct3D 11 headers as part of this 7.1 era toolset which are outdated compared to the Windows 8.x SDK versions using the standard ``v110`` Platform Toolset, particularly the SDK Debug Layers installed by the Windows 8.0 SDK on Windows 7 and Windows 8. The Platform Toolset ``v110_xp`` is therefore not recommended for developing DirectX 11 applications, but it can technically be done with some caution. <em>Windows SDK 7.1A</em> does not contain a <code>dxguid.lib</code> so must either locally define the required GUIDs in your project by using <code>#define INITGUID</code> in one of your .cpp files, or use the legacy <em>DirectX SDK </em>version.

This also means that the 'search path order' guidance for ``v110_xp`` is different than the Windows 8.x SDK recommendations on <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/directx-sdk--august-2009-">Microsoft Docs</a>. For ``v110_xp`` you should use the legacy order:

```
$(DXSDK_DIR)Include;$(IncludePath)
$(DXSDK_DIR)Lib\x86;$(LibraryPath)
```

For ``v110`` if you are using legacy DirectX SDK components for an EXE that does not support Windows XP:

```
$(IncludePath);$(DXSDK_DIR)Include

$(LibraryPath);$(DXSDK_DIR)Lib\x86
or
$(LibraryPath);$(DXSDK_DIR)Lib\x64
```

<strong>``_WIN32_WINNT``:</strong> When building an application that is 'down-level' when using headers in the Windows 8.x SDK, be sure to explicitly select the correct 'minimum' ``_WIN32_WINNT`` value. For Windows 8, that is 0x0602 (which is the default when building code with Visual Studio 2012 and for all Windows Store apps). For Windows 7 use 0x0601, and for Windows Vista use 0x0600. When using ``v110_xp`` set it to <code>0x0502</code> (the Visual C++ REDIST requires Windows XP Service Pack 3). Typically this is done as part of the project configuration via Preprocessor Definitions. See <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/WinProg/using-the-windows-headers">Using the Windows Headers</a> for more information.

<strong>Note:</strong> The Direct3D 9 Developer Runtime is only available on Windows 7 or older versions of the OS using the legacy DirectX SDK. Direct3D 9 debugging is not supported for Windows 8.x or Windows 10.

<strong>Windows Server:</strong> Targeting Window Server 2003 or Windows Server 2003 R2 also requires the use of ``v110_xp``.

<strong>VS 2013:</strong> This information also applies to Visual C++ 2013's ``v120_xp`` platform target.

<strong>VS 2015:</strong> This information also applies to Visual C++ 2015's ``v140_xp``platform target. Note that a number of warnings are generated in system headers when using the older SDK with the newer compiler. You will need to select the optional component <em>Windows XP Support for C++ </em>in the <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/setup-changes-in-visual-studio-2015-affecting-c-developers/">custom install</a>.

<strong>VS 2017:</strong> This information also applies to Visual C++ 2017's ``v141_xp`` platform target. Note that a number of warnings are generated in system headers when using the older SDK with the newer compiler, and you won't be able to make use of <code>/permissive-</code>.  You will need to install additional optional component <em>Windows XP Support for C++</em> (<code>Microsoft.VisualStudio.Component.WinXP</code> and <code>Microsoft.VisualStudio.ComponentGroup.NativeDesktop.WinXP</code>) in the <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/the-lightweight-visual-studio-15-installer/">installer</a>.

<strong>VS 2019:</strong> Visual C++ 2019 does not have a newer Platform Toolset for Windows XP. It continues to support the VS 2017 era ``v141_xp`` Platform Toolset if you install the <em>Windows XP Support for VS 2017 (v141) tools</em> component. See [Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/porting/features-deprecated-in-visual-studio?view=vs-2019).

<h1>DirectXMath and Windows XP</h1>

<a href="https://walbourn.github.io/introducing-directxmath/">DirectXMath</a> in the Windows 8.x SDK is compatible with Windows XP, but the ``v110_xp`` Platform Toolset include paths will not find it. You can make use <a href="https://walbourn.github.io/xna-math-version-2-05-smoothing-the-transition-to-directxmath/">XNAMath 2.05</a> for your Windows XP configurations, or you can make a copy of the DirectXMath headers in the project for Windows XP configurations--DirectXMath can also obtained directly from <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/DirectXMath">GitHub</a>.

<h1>Microsoft::WRL::ComPtr and Windows XP</h1>

A similar issue to the one with DirectXMath arises when using the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/wrl/comptr-class">ComPtr</a> smart-pointer: the ``v110_xp`` Platform Toolset include paths will not find <code>wrl.h</code> or ``wrl\client.h``. You can use ATL's <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/atl/reference/ccomptr-class">CComPtr</a> instead when targeting Windows XP, but remember that <code>operator&</code> with ATL's <code>CComPtr</code> maps to <code>GetAddressOf()</code> while the same operator with <code>Microsoft::WRL::ComPtr</code> maps to <code>ReleaseAndGetAddressOf()</code>.

<h1>Code Analysis</h1>

This update includes Code Analysis <code>/analyze</code> support for Windows phone 8 applications (i.e. when using the Platform Toolset ``v110_wp80``)

Note that the Platform Toolset ``v110_xp`` does not support Code Analysis <code>/analyze</code> which is disabled due to incompatibilities with the <em>Windows SDK 7.1A</em> headers.
