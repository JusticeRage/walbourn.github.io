I've done my first releases of 2020 of my various GitHub projects, and there's a number of changes worth mentioning. This includes updates to _DirectX Tool Kit_ for both [DX11](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectXTK/releases/tag/feb2020) and [DX12](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectXTK12/releases/tag/feb2020), [DirectXTex](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectXTex/releases/tag/feb2020), [DirectXMesh](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectXMesh/releases/tag/feb2020), and [UVAtlas](https://github.com/microsoft/UVAtlas/releases/tag/feb2020), as well as a number of changes to my [NuGet](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/what-is-nuget) packages in particular.

# VS 2015 Retirement

First up, I've retired all the VS 2015 projects for my GitHub projects. I've been maintaining VS 2015 Update 3, VS 2017, and VS 2019 for a while but for this year I've trimmed it back to just two versions again. There are a number of technical reasons for this, but the Windows 10 SDK itself hasn't officially supported VS 2015 since the [Creators Update (15063)](https://walbourn.github.io/windows-10-creators-update-sdk/) back in March 2017. Hopefully this won't be a problem for users of the libraries.

As a consequence, I've deprecated the following NuGet packages: [directxtk_desktop_2015](https://www.nuget.org/packages/directxtk_desktop_2015), [directxtk12_desktop_2015](
https://www.nuget.org/packages/directxtk12_desktop_2015), [directxtex_desktop_2015](https://www.nuget.org/packages/directxtex_desktop_2015), [directxmesh_desktop_2015](https://www.nuget.org/packages/directxmesh_desktop_2015), and [fx11_desktop_2015](https://www.nuget.org/packages/fx11_desktop_2015/). VS 2017 and VS 2019 projects that use one of these packages should uninstall them and replace it with the new package: [directxtk_desktop_2017](https://www.nuget.org/packages/directxtk_desktop_2017), [directxtk12_desktop_2017](https://www.nuget.org/packages/directxtk12_desktop_2017), [directxtex_desktop_2017](https://www.nuget.org/packages/directxtex_desktop_2017), [directxmesh_desktop_2017](https://www.nuget.org/packages/directxmesh_desktop_2017), and [fx11_desktop_2017](https://www.nuget.org/packages/fx11_desktop_2017/).

Note I also now have a UVAtlas NuGet package: [uvatlas_desktop_2017](https://www.nuget.org/packages/uvatlas_desktop_2017).

# ARM64 Desktop Support

The Universal Windows Platform (UWP) app platform has supported ARM and ARM64 for a [while](https://walbourn.github.io/vs-2017-15-9-update/), and I support those platform configurations in my UWP projects and NuGet packages: [directxtk_uwp](https://www.nuget.org/packages/directxtk_uwp), [directxtk12_uwp](https://www.nuget.org/packages/directxtk12_uwp), [directxtex_uwp](https://www.nuget.org/packages/directxtex_uwp), and [directxmesh_uwp](https://www.nuget.org/packages/directxmesh_uwp).

What's new is that [ARM64 Win32 desktop](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/arm/) development is now supported, primarily to provide optimized applications for devices like the _Surface Pro X_. The following NuGet packages include ARM64 platform "desktop" configurations: [directxtk_desktop_win10](https://www.nuget.org/packages/directxtk_desktop_win10), [directxtk12_desktop_2017](https://www.nuget.org/packages/directxtk12_desktop_2017), [directxtex_desktop_win10](https://www.nuget.org/packages/directxtex_desktop_win10), and [directxmesh_desktop_win10](https://www.nuget.org/packages/directxmesh_desktop_win10).

> [DirectXMath](https://github.com/Microsoft/DirectXMath) has supported ARM64 for a numbers of years as noted in [this blog post](https://walbourn.github.io/directxmath-arm64/). This works 'as is' for UWP and ARM64 desktop apps.

# DirectX Tool Kit for Audio

Per [this post](https://walbourn.github.io/twilight-for-windows-7/), there's no compelling reason to keep using the [legacy DirectX SDK](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/directx-sdk--august-2009-) any more thanks to the release of the [XAudio2Redist](https://aka.ms/XAudio2Redist) NuGet package that provides a down-level version of XAudio 2.9 for Windows 7 SP1 and Windows 8.x, and uses the built-in version for Windows 10 automatically. I've updated _DirectX Tool Kit for Audio_ to support building against the new Redist version which greatly simplifies XAudio2 usage on Windows 7 SP1 as well as providing xWMA support on Windows 8.x. The result is the same XAudio 2.9 API on Windows 10 (with a few minor caveats) on all these platforms.

The [directxtk_desktop_2017](https://www.nuget.org/packages/directxtk_desktop_2017) NuGet package has a dependency on [XAudio2Redist](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.XAudio2.Redist/). The GamePad input class uses XInput 9.1.0 to support Windows 7 SP1 without requiring the legacy DirectSetup REDIST, and the rest of the graphics components were already building for Windows 7 compatibility.

The [directxtk_desktop_win10](https://www.nuget.org/packages/directxtk_desktop_win10) and [directxtk12_desktop_2017](https://www.nuget.org/packages/directxtk12_desktop_2017) NuGet packages are configured for Windows 10 only, so they use the built-in XAudio 2.9. Therefore they do not require ``Microsoft.XAudio2.Redist``, and neither do the UWP app packages ``directxtk_uwp`` / ``directxtk12_uwp``.

> I've kept the XAudio 2.7 legacy DirectX SDK support in place in the GitHub repo, but I expect to retire it fully at some point later in the year.

# Additional Notes

* Thanks to a community contribution, I now have [WaveFront OBJ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavefront_.obj_file) export support for DirectXMesh's ``meshconvert.exe`` and UVAtlas' ``uvatlastool.exe``. These tools already read input from WaveFront OBJ but only produced ``CMO``, ``SDKMESH`` or ``VBO``; but now they also offer ``OBJ``. It's a very basic format, but easy to read and well-understood.

* Inspired by the [CMake](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/category/cmake/) and [clang/LLVM](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/category/clang/) support added to Visual Studio 2019, I've authored ``CMakeLists.txt`` for all my libraries and tools, and validate code using Visual C++ as well as clang for Windows v9. I've worked to make all my projects build with ``/Wall`` which for clang is really damn verbose to help ensure a high level of C++ conformance. I don't personally put time into getting them to build for non-Windows platforms, but this should make it easier for other projects to do so if there is a desire for it.

* The various tools like ``MakeSpriteFont.exe``, ``xwbtool.exe``, ``meshconvert.exe``, ``texconv.exe`` etc. for my latest GitHub releases are now all digitally signed and versioned.

* If you look at the [wiki](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectXTK/wiki) pages for my GitHub projects, you may notice a bunch of new [shields](https://img.shields.io) for the GitHub repos, NuGet packages, and builds. There are now nightly builds pipelines hosted on [Azure DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/solutions/devops/) for both the primary library repos and the auxiliary test repos. I've been building the tests adhoc for many years, but put some time in to automate them.

* I finally got around to converting all my Readme files for my GitHub projects from text files to Markdown ``README.md``. I've split out the complete release histories into their own ``HISTORY.md``.
