# DirectX 12
One of the announcements is the release of the [DirectX 12 Agility SDK](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/directx/announcing-dx12agility/). This is a combination of the latest system headers for DirectX 12 being available from [GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectX-Headers), [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Direct3D.D3D12/), or [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg/tree/master/ports/directx-headers), plus redistributable binaries in a [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Direct3D.D3D12/) package that provides DirectX 12 feature updates on Windows 10 November 2019 Update or later. This includes OS support for the new [DirectX Ultimate](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/directx/announcing-directx-12-ultimate/) Direct3D Hardware Feature Level 12.2 and [Shader Model 6.6](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/directx/hlsl-shader-model-6-6/). Full details are covered in the [Getting Started Guide](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/directx/gettingstarted-dx12agility/). There's also a new version of [PIX](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/pix/pix-2104/) which supports the new features.

# DirectX Landing Page

There's now a [DirectX Landing Page](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/directx/landing-page/). It includes a link to the various resources for using DirectX 12, and also includes links to my various related GitHub projects. It's a handy link to keep around.
