<em>The <a href="https://walbourn.github.io/visual-studio-11-beta/">Beta</a> is now available, so should be used instead of the older Developer Preview mentioned here.</em>

The next version of Visual Studio is currently <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?displaylang=en&id=27543">available</a> for download as a Developer Preview. This release includes a new C++ compiler and Standard Library with additional <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/c11-features-in-visual-c-11/">C++11</a> support, an integrated <em>PIX for Windows</em> replacement called <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/game-debugging-in-visual-studio-11/"><em>Visual Studio Graphics Diagnostics</em> </a>including HLSL debugging, the latest HLSL compiler, and a DDS image viewer (both legacy and 'DX10' extension variants).

<strong>Note:</strong> The VS 11 Developer Preview includes a preview version of the next Windows SDK integrated into the release which requires some build settings changes to compile DirectX SDK samples. See "<a href="https://aka.ms/dxsdk">Where is the DirectX SDK</a>" for details.
